Two types of Export 

1. Default export - export default Header - import Header from ''
2. Named export - export { c1 , c2 } - import { c1 , c2 } from ''

In single component - export default work
In more than one - export { c1 , c2 } - named export

A hook is normal Javascript Utility function given to us by React

Whenever a State variable updates React re-render the component

React keep your `UI Layer` sync with `Data Layer`

How React works behind the scenes?

REACT RECONCILIATION ALGORITHM aka REACT FIBER- https://medium.com/javarevisited/react-reconciliation-algorithm-86e3e22c1b40

VIRTUAL DOM (Normal JS Object)- is a representation of Actual DOM

DIFF ALGORITHM - Find difference b/w Old VDOM and Updated VDOM
It will calculate the difference and update Actual DOM in the most efficient way

REACT FIBER ARCHITECTURE - https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfRestaurants] = useState(restaurants)

These two variables act as trigger to start diff algorithm

useState() - returns Array
