props - Properties - Passing arguments to a function
React will take the props and it wrap in inside object and pass it to the function

Config Driven UI

We can send props as JS Object

When we are looping on Components we have to pass key as a props
All components have to be their unique Id for better optimizations

if we don't use key React re-renders all the Components
By `key` react can identify it and re renders that particular Component

Never use index as Key in React
