FLUX - RTK

Redux is State Management Library
Redux work in DATA LAYER 
Redux offers easy debugging

There are two libraries that redux team offers - Redux and Redux Toolkit

React Redux - it is a bridge between React and Redux
Redux Toolkit 

We have Slices , Dispatcher , Reducers , Selectors

Redux Store is a JS object with lot of data inside it kept in a global scope
What is Slices - Logical Separation - like UserSlice, CartSlice

Redux uses - Immer Js - Finding diff b/w Mutated State and Original State and gives back the new immutable state 

IMMER LIBRARY - https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer

When we click on Add button it dispatches action which call the reducer function that modifies the slice of the store

Getting Data from Store using Selectors also known as Subscribing to the Store 

As our Cart is in Header - The Header component is subscribed to this store using a Selector

RTK - Either Mutate the existing state or return a new state

Make sure you are Subscribing right portion of store for optimization purpose

const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items)  ✅
const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store) ❌

Use Reducer and Reducers carefully
